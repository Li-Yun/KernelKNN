# KernelKNN

It is a simple implementation K Nearest Neighbor (K-NN) and Kernel K Nearest Neighbor (Kernel K-NN).
This implementation evaluates K-NN and kernelized K-NN on four different datasets: 2-d dataexamples,
Iris dataset, MNIST dataset, and CIFAR10 dataset.

# Usage

To run the program, you must download the following datasets and put all of them into this repo.

MNIST: https://pjreddie.com/projects/mnist-in-csv/
CIFAR 10: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html
